## Flatmates Bill

This app takes the amount of a bill for a particular period and the days that each of the flatmates stayed in the house for that period as the input and returns how much each flatmate has to pay. It also generates a PDF report stating the names of the flatmates, the period, and how much each of them had to pay.
